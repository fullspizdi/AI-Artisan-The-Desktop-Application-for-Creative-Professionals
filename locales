# locales/ directory is intended to store localization files for different languages supported by AI Artisan.
# Each file within this directory will contain language-specific strings and other locale-specific data
# to be used throughout the application for multilingual support.

# Example of a simple JSON structure for English (US):
{
  "appTitle": "AI Artisan",
  "menu": {
    "file": "File",
    "edit": "Edit",
    "view": "View",
    "help": "Help"
  },
  "messages": {
    "welcome": "Welcome to AI Artisan",
    "exitConfirmation": "Are you sure you want to exit?"
  },
  "errors": {
    "networkError": "Network error, please check your connection."
  }
}

# Similar JSON structures should be created for other supported languages:
# - French (France) - fr-FR.json
# - Spanish (Spain) - es-ES.json
# - German (Germany) - de-DE.json
# - Chinese (China) - zh-CN.json

# Each JSON file will be named according to the locale code and will contain the translated strings.
# The application will load the appropriate file based on the user's language settings.
